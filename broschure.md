# Welcome to Shared Space

Shared space puts all the users of the road on the same level, in the same space. It sounds like a revolutionary idea, but it is the way all streets were, around the world, before cars began to dominate the street.

Instead of taking each other for granted and relying on rules, painted lines and signs to keep us safe, humans in shared spaces using different modes of transit interact and negotiate their way through the space using eye contact and communication at low, safe speeds. Some of the tools of shared spaces include:

* removing curbs and painted lines
* bringing the speed limits down to 25km/h or less; areas of very high pedestrian traffic could even be 10km/h
* reducing the number of signs to decrease distractions
* use bollards, and uneven street surfacing to indicate a unique space which requires attention

Roads are for getting around on quickly, by car and bus.  
Streets are for living in.  
Shared space is to make the *streets* better, safer, and more fun, not to replace *roads*.
