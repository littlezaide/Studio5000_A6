# Shared Space

Shared space puts all the users of the road on the same level, in the same space. It sounds like a revolutionary idea, but it is merely the way streets used to be in the early twentieth century when cars were only just beginning to be common.

Where pedestrians, cyclists and cars mix, strip away the signs the curbs, the painted lines, and bring the speed limits for motor vehicles down to 25km/h or less. Reduce the numbers of signs to decrease the distractions. 

Instead of taking each other for granted and relying on the rules to work, humans in shared spaces using different modes of transit interact and negotiate their way through the space with eye contact and communication at low, safe speeds.
