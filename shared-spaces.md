# Halifax 1910

Up until the 1920s in North America, they were just called streets.

# It Goes By A Few Different Names

notes:
Street designs in Halifax already have to include all sustainable modes of transportation and all levels of mobility. 

The idea we're presenting today is a concept of street space where everyone shares equally: pedestrians, cars, bikes, wheelchairs, skateboards. There are few or no signs at all. Eye-contact and negotiation allows users in different modes to share the space, and speeds are low to make that communication possible --- 20km/h or even as low as 10km/h.
