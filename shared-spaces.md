# Halifax 1910

Up until the 1920s in North America, they were just called streets.

Halifax already has a *complete streets* policy in the regional plan; that means all street designs have to include all sustainable modes of transportation and all levels of mobility. The shared space idea we're presenting today is one form of complete streets where all the street users share the same space: pedestrians, cars, bikes, wheelchairs, skateboards. Speed limits are very low by design --- 30km/h or as low as 10km/h. There's no sign It's not a concept which works everyw

There is a continuum from the current conventional street which serves a range of functions which are physically separated or demarcated with paint. 

Shared space is not a set of design guidelines it is a design concept which can be implemented in many different ways, and at many different scales.
